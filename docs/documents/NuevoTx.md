title: NuevoTx - de novo transcriptome assembly
permalink: /documents/NuevoTx
---

Many 'gene' sequences in AmphiBase were derived from RNA-seq data without genome. 
All codes are available at [NuevoTx GitHub repo](https://github.com/taejoonlab/NuevoTx/)

## Step 1. Do transcript assembly and clustering.

## Step 2. Remove the redundant sequences.

## Step 3. Evaulate possible translated protein sequences.

## Step 4. Make the representative sequences for each species.
