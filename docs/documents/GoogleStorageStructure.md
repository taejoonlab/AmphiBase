We managed all data for AmphiBase at [Google Cloud Storage](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/tklab-amphibase/).

## Data folders
The following data folders contain the subfolder with species name (with underscores instead of whitespaces). 
Species folder under main data folders contains cDNA and protein sequences. 

# Main Data folders
* Anura: the sequences of Anura species
* Caudata: the sequences of Caudata species
* Gymnophiona: the sequences of Gymnophiona species

# Additional data folders
* genomes: only several Amphibian species have genome sequences so we maintain it in a separate folder.
* archive: raw data to construct gene sequences. The folders named as same as the main data folders were located.
* db: databases and tools used in AmphiBase.
